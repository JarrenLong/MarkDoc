# MarkDoc

## Getting Started:

The first thing you will want to do is upload your markdown files using FTP/SFTP/whatever. After doing this, go to the [Table of Contents](?p=toc), and click on the "Generate Tabl of Contents" link. This will update the table of contents with a master list of all Markdown files currently present in your website.
