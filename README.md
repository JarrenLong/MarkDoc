## What is MarkDoc?

MarkDoc is a tool that allows you to quickly generate a website for your product, without having to learn how to build a website from scratch. MarkDoc takes documents that you can write using a simple text editor (like Notepad or nano), and converts them into beautiful websites with the click of a button by leveraging the power of the Markdown language.

## Getting Started:

Using MarkDoc is very easy, and can be set up and running in under five minutes using the following process:

1. Install MarkDoc on your web host
2. Upload your Markdown files, or Import them from a WordPress website
3. Generate a Table of Contents
4. Customize your website
